I have a technical article about a Flutter topic. Your task is to:

Carefully analyze the content of the article.

Identify the main technique or idea being explained.

Design a real-world use case where this technique can be effectively applied.

Rewrite the implementation as a complete, production-ready feature, with clean architecture principles:

Separate widgets into individual classes with clear responsibilities.

Give services meaningful and specific names that reflect their role (e.g., UserProfileSyncService instead of ApiService).

Use Mixins for shared behavior in views to reduce duplication and improve readability.

Follow standard Flutter folder structure (e.g., /views, /models, /services, /widgets).

Add clear comments explaining the logic, especially in non-trivial areas.

Include improvements, optimizations, or alternatives if the articleâ€™s solution has any shortcomings.

Provide a short summary at the end:

What problem this implementation solves

Where and how it fits within a scalable Flutter project
